    <content type="html">
      &lt;p&gt;I first saw this show as a teenager. It was airing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_(TV_channel)&quot;&gt;local anime channel&lt;/a&gt;, as part of their western adult-focused content.
And it was a spanish dub. The humor was peculiar, the animation style was unique. I liked it, but did not think much of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was when rediscovering it a few years later than I realized the genius of this show: It&#39;s just all a great excuse to have comedians come in and do a few minutes of material, as-is.
The therapy setting makes it just work. And these were not just random comedians. You had Ron Lynch, Sarah Silverman, Jake Johannsen, Judy Tenuta, Louis CK, David Cross, and the list just keeps going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m linking to Johnatan&#39;s website, you can find the show on DVD and online as well.&lt;/p&gt;
