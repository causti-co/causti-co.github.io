                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.Sat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">We had good cable in Argentina</a>. My theory is that this was mostly economy-driven: We got anime because it was cheaper to license these strange cartoons from Japan that nobody knew about, than the hits from the US. And it was the same with comedy, we got a lot of British shows that nobody had heard about.</p>
      <p>Peep Show was one of them. I won't try to describe the show, you need to go and watch it, and I've linked the first season which someone uploaded to <a href="https://archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a>. Ok, ok, I'll try to describe it, but I'll keep it very short and simple: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBsaJPkt2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cringe</a>. You're not supposed to know what goes on inside the minds of this kind of people, but you do, and you're forced to on the ride with them. This was also my first contact with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mitchell_(comedian)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Mitchell</a>. He's, unsurprisingly, my kind of person.</p>

                  <p>There's this playlist that I keep open in my browser. It's been open for at least 10 years. Every time it gets to the end, I go back to the beginning and start listening again.</p>
      <p>What's in the playlist? 440+ hours of audio, consisting of every time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_O%27Neal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrice O'Neal</a> was a guest on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opie_and_Anthony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Opie &amp; Anthony radio show</a>. It's one thing to listen to a stand-up comedian while they are doing a special, or an interview at a late-night show. But it's something completely different when you get to listen to them just talk shit with their friends. Sure, now that everybody and their mother has a podcast this is not as unique, but you need to put yourself 20 years back in time, when this stuff was going on (the first episodes with Patrice are from 2002). And this was not just Patrice, but rather the entire <a href="https://www.comedycellar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comedy Cellar</a> crowd: <a href="https://www.jimnorton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Norton</a> (3rd mic on O&amp;A), <a href="https://robertkellylive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Kelly</a>, <a href="https://www.richvos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rich Vos</a>, <a href="https://billburr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Burr</a>, <a href="https://www.nickdip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Di Paolo</a>, <a href="https://colinquinn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Quinn</a>, <a href="https://louisck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis CK</a>.</p>

                  <p>This was the first CD that I ever bought.</p>
      <p>As an awkward geeky teenager, I'd say it's impossible not to relate to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo18VIoR2xU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a>. The fact that I've had migraines since I was a kid definitely did not help.</p>
      <p>But this rec is not about the movie, it's about its soundtrack. Just take a look at <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/60010-Various-%CF%80-Music-For-The-Motion-Picture" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the track list</a>. This is how I found out about <a href="https://aphextwin.warp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aphex Twin</a> and <a href="https://www.autechre.ws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autechre</a>. This how I discovered <a href="https://ronisize.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roni Size</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drum and bass</a> in general. Yes, the rest of the album is great, don't feel sad I did not call your specific artist out, geez.</p>

                  <p>I first saw this show as a teenager. It was airing in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotion_(TV_channel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local anime channel</a>, as part of their western adult-focused content.
      And it was a Spanish dub. The humor was peculiar, the animation style was unique. I liked it, but did not think much of it.</p>
      <p>It was when rediscovering it a few years later than I realized the genius of this show: It's just all a great excuse to have comedians come in and do a few minutes of material, as-is.
      The therapy setting makes it just work. And these were not just random comedians. You had <a href="https://www.ronlynch1.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ron Lynch</a>, <a href="https://sarahsilvermanmerch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Silverman</a>, <a href="https://www.jakethis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake Johannsen</a>, <a href="https://www.judytenuta.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judy Tenuta</a>, <a href="https://louisck.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis CK</a>, <a href="https://officialdavidcross.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Cross</a>, and the list <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dr._Katz,_Professional_Therapist_episodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just keeps going</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm linking to Jonathan's website, you can find the show on DVD and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3H6z037pboGUWNoRht95JX5Vo15ZKtFb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a> as well. Please <strong>do not</strong> watch the &quot;HD&quot; version, it's an AI upscale that completely destroys the original animation style.</p>
